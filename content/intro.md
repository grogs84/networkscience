# Introduction to Network Science

This is the introduction chapter to Network Science.

## What is Network Science?

Network science is an academic field that studies complex networks such as telecommunication networks, computer networks, biological networks, cognitive and semantic networks, and social networks. The field draws on theories and methods from mathematics, physics, biology, computer science, and sociology.

## Key Concepts

- **Nodes (Vertices)**: The fundamental units of a network
- **Edges (Links)**: Connections between nodes
- **Network Topology**: The arrangement of nodes and edges in a network
- **Network Properties**: Characteristics that describe the structure and behavior of networks

## Why Study Networks?

Networks are everywhere in our modern world:
- Social networks connect people
- Infrastructure networks (power grids, transportation systems)
- Biological networks (protein interactions, neural connections)
- Information networks (the internet, citation networks)

Understanding networks helps us:
- Predict system behavior
- Identify influential nodes
- Optimize network design
- Detect anomalies and failures
